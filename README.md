![NLP topic image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/main/topics/nlp/nlp.png)

A production-first roadmap for advanced NLP and LLM systems.

## 1. Systems Foundations (CUDA, Triton, Memory) üß©

Explainer
- Low-level performance drives cost and latency. You need to know GPU scheduling, kernel design, memory hierarchy, and data movement to optimize LLM serving.

What you'll learn

Practical tasks
- Implement a fused attention kernel in Triton and measure throughput.
- Build a memory planner that places KV cache and activations across GPUs.
- Use profiling traces to reduce PCIe transfers and improve utilization.

---

## 2. Attention & KV-Cache Internals üîë

Explainer
- KV-cache stores past key/value tensors for autoregressive decode. Efficient layout and retrieval cut memory and latency.

What you'll learn
- KV-cache layout strategies (per-layer vs fused).
- Sparse and quantized KV-cache options.
- Cache eviction and state migration for multi-session serving.
- Fast cache slice transfer for multi-GPU contexts.

Resources
- Transformer attention mechanics.
- Papers on attention complexity and kernel fusion.
- Open-source KV-cache implementations in Triton/CUDA.

Practical tasks
- Implement a contiguous KV-cache layout that supports fast append and slice.
- Measure latency of cache retrieval for long-context prompts.
- Add compression to KV storage and benchmark trade-offs.

---

## 3. Decoding for Throughput & Quality üß≠

Explainer
- Decoding strategy affects latency and output quality. Beam search, sampling, and optimized batched greedy decode each suit different SLAs.

What you'll learn
- Batched beam search, grouped sampling, and token-level parallelism.
- Micro-batching for throughput while preserving per-session state.
- Early stop, length normalization, and repetition penalty in production.

Resources
- Papers on decoding algorithms and efficient batching.
- Implementations in Hugging Face, FasterTransformer, and triton-decode examples.

Practical tasks
- Build a batched decoding loop that pipelines model compute and token emission.
- Implement a scheduler that balances latency-sensitive sessions against throughput workloads.
- Compare output quality and cost for top-k, nucleus sampling, and beam search at various batch sizes.

---

## 4. Quantization (Weights, Activations, KV Cache) ‚öñÔ∏è

Explainer
- Quantization reduces memory and increases throughput. Production requires stable accuracy and fast kernels.

What you'll learn
- Post-training and aware quantization techniques: 8-bit, 4-bit, and mixed precision.
- Activation quantization during inference and reconstruction error.
- Quantized KV-cache encoding and decode cost.
- Quantization-aware calibration and per-channel scales.

Resources
- Papers on GPTQ, AWQ, and QLoRA.
- Implementations in bitsandbytes and custom Triton kernels.

Practical tasks
- Apply 4-bit weight quantization to a decoder-only model and measure perplexity.
- Implement int8 matmul kernel and test throughput on A100 and consumer GPUs.
- Store KV-cache in quantized form and compare memory vs. decode overhead.

---

## 5. Sparsity & Pruning ‚úÇÔ∏è

Explainer
- Sparsity reduces FLOPs and memory. MoE and structured pruning provide different trade-offs for latency and cost.

What you'll learn
- Structured vs unstructured pruning and their runtime cost.
- Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing, capacity, and load balancing.
- Sparse kernels and runtime dispatch for MoE layers.

- Combine local context with RAG and evaluate end-to-end latency.

## 7. Streaming & State Space Models ‚è©

Explainer
- Streaming systems must emit tokens as they arrive. State Space Models (SSMs) and S4 provide an alternative to attention for long-range streaming.

## 8. PEFT & Deployment Patterns üß∞

Explainer
- Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) enables cheaper model updates. Production needs safe rollout and monitoring.

What you'll learn
- LoRA, adapters, and prompt tuning patterns.
- Canary releases, shadow traffic, and safe rollback.
- Logging, metrics, and evaluation for model updates.

Resources
- LoRA and adapter papers and implementations.
- SRE patterns for model deployment and monitoring.

Practical tasks

## Example Workflows and Recipes

- Low-latency chat: Use fused Triton kernels, per-session KV-cache, and batched greedy decode. Measure p50/p95 latency and tune batch sizes.
- Cost-optimized serving: Apply 4-bit quantization, run on mixed GPU types, and use autoscaling based on queue depth.
- Long-document QA: Combine retrieval index, chunked encoder, compressed memory, and RAG for factual grounding.
- MoE for bursty traffic: Route small requests to expert subsets and fall back to a dense model for rare routes.

Commands (examples in release)
- ./install.sh
- docker build -t adv-nlp:latest -f docker/Dockerfile .
- ./run_server.sh --model quantized/4bit --port 8080
- scripts/profile_kernel.sh triton_attention_kernel
